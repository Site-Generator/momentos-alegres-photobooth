# Momentos Alegres Photobooth — site content

This repo holds **Momentos Alegres Photobooth's** website content only:
`club.json` and `images/`. Edit them via [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org)
(see `.pages.yml`) or directly on GitHub.

**Do not hand-edit anything under `generator/`.** That folder is a synced
copy of the shared [club-site-generator-core](https://github.com/Site-Generator/club-site-generator-core)
engine, pulled in via `git subtree`. Engine bugs/features are fixed there and
propagated here — a local edit under `generator/` risks a conflict the next
time that sync runs.

**Want a custom design for this site only?** Add a `custom-template/` folder
here at the repo root (sibling to `club.json`, not inside `generator/`),
mirroring `generator/template/`'s structure — e.g. `custom-template/style.css`
or `custom-template/sections/officers.html`. The build uses any file found
there instead of the built-in default, and falls back to the default for
anything you don't override. This is the supported way to diverge from the
shared design; it never conflicts with future engine syncs.

## Building locally

```bash
npm --prefix generator install
CLUB_DATA_DIR=.. CLUB_SLUG=momentosalegresphotobooth node generator/build.js
npm --prefix generator run preview   # serves generator/dist/ at localhost:8877
```

## Deploying

Pushes to `main` deploy automatically via
[`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml),
which builds with `CLUB_SLUG=momentosalegresphotobooth`,
`CLUB_DATA_DIR=..` and publishes `generator/dist/` to GitHub Pages. The
repo's Pages source (Settings → Pages) must be set to "GitHub Actions".
